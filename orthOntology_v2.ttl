ORTH ontology is designed to describe sequence homology data available in multiple orthology databases on the Web (e.g.: [OMA](https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/), [OrthoDB](http://www.orthodb.org/), [HieranoiDB](http://hieranoidb.sbc.su.se/)). By sequence homology data, we mostly mean gene region, gene and protein-centric orthology, paralogy, and xenology information. Depending on the database, the homology information is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology accommodates these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG), cluster of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences. In addition to the specific ORTH terms, this specification includes terms of the imported ontologies (e.g. Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, SIO) which are pertinent to represent the information from various orthology databases in a homogeneous way." ;

                            widoco:introduction '''The shared genes among different species are evidence of evolution from a common ancestor. For example, we share approximately 90% of our genes with mice. These related genes are called orthologs. Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by a speciation event. These genes are normally thought to retain the same function. The functional conservation of related genes across species explains the success of model organism-based research, which enables knowledge on human biology and medicine to be gained from other species, such as mice, fruit fly, or yeast. In this context, the knowledge of orthologs between, say, mice and humans allows for studying biological processes in mice, and then transferring the knowledge to humans.

The community of orthology researchers has increased its interest for ontologies in the last years since the creation of [the Quest for Orthologs (QfO) consortium](https://questfororthologs.org/). QfO pursues the standardization and interoperability of orthology resources and methods, including the development of common standards and formats for the representation of orthology information and knowledge. The 2013 QfO meeting identified the potential benefits of semantic web technologies for the interoperability of orthology information. Since then, QfO researchers developed the first version of the Orthology Ontology (ORTH) available on the [QfO github](https://github.com/qfo/OrthologyOntology/blob/master/oo.owl), which served to demonstrate the feasibility of creating semantically interoperable orthology resources. The experience with the ORTH has shown some limitations for the activities needed by the QfO community. More concretely, new homology-related concepts need to be formalized in the ontology and some aspects of the current representation need to be improved in order to permit a more powerful, reasoning-based exploitation of orthology data. Therefore, in this second version of the ORTH ontology, new concepts and properties were included to be able to describe information available in more than 40 [orthology databases](https://questfororthologs.org/orthology_databases).

Although, the methods used to generate homology information by the orthology databases focus on predicting orthology, they also provide other homology information such as paralogy. Besides this, these databases structure the data in one or more different manners such as hierarchical and non-hierarchical clusters, and pairwise relations. Often, these data structures are the result of the prediction approaches. A homology ontology (HOM) already exists and it is available [here](https://github.com/BgeeDB/homology-ontology), however it does not focus on describing the orthology databases as a data schema. Actually, the HOM ontology defines an homology taxonomy that can be used to annotate homology-related data. By using the [SKOS vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html), we aligned both ORTH and HOM ontologies. The alignment is available to download on the [QfO GitHub](https://github.com/qfo/OrthologyOntology/blob/master/HOM_ORTH_skos_alignment.ttl).

Moreover, the ORTH ontology available to download and described in this specification, it is indeed a view that contains imported ontology terms without frequently considering all related axioms (e.g., annotations or class hierarchy). This view was built to define a domain ontology designed to describe homology information from multiple orthology databases. By doing so, the proposed ORTH ontology view simplifies the understandability and the use of ORTH by orthology database owners. To enhance information interoperability among biological databases, we defined a first draft of the Life Science Cross-references [(LSCR) ontology](https://purl.org/lscr) that mainly defines sub-properties of the [rdfs:seeAlso](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso) property such as lscr:xrefUniprot. These LSCR properties can be used to explicitly assign cross-references to external databases. Cross-references can be interpreted as the intersection points among orthology database resources. The LSCR is available to download on the [QfO GitHub](https://github.com/qfo/OrthologyOntology/blob/master/lscr.ttl).

Depending on the homology data structure generated by the orthology database owners, the most appropriate concepts and relations (e.g., [Hierarchical Orthologous Cluster (HOG), flat clusters, and pairwise) should be used to represent homology data. For example, by querying the HOGs, additional information can be extracted such as the pairwise orthology relations without needing to materialize them, because that would increase significantly the number of triples to store in the already large orthology datasets.

The structure of the rest of the ORTH specification is described next. In Section 2, we will provide an overview of the ORTH ontology and a graphical visualisation. Section 3 describes ORTH focusing on different types of data structures to represent homology information and several query examples. Finally, ORTH classes and properties are fully explained and exemplified in Section 4. ''';
                            dct:description '''The ORTH ontology mainly accommodates three different types of data structures to represent homology information. These data structures may encapsulate information that can often be inferred or queried instead of being materialised. They are described in the next subsections. In Ref. [[1]](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2042/paper36.pdf), we demonstrate that for one given orthology database billions of [is orthologous](#hasOrtholog) to assertions can be inferred instead of materialised from the hierarchical orthologous groups (i.e.: space O(n2) where n is the number of genes). Figure 1 illustrates these data structures according to the verbosity (i.e.: the number of needed triples) and the implicit information encapsulated.

*Figure 1. The different levels of homology information expressiveness by using ORTH ontology.*

### Non-hierarchical cluster of homologous sequences

Several orthology databases solely generate non-hierarchical [clusters of homologous sequences](#HomologsCluster)  or besides HOGs, they provide non-hierarchical clusters (i.e.: groups). Frequently the number of pairwise homology relations derived from the non-hierarchical [clusters of homologous sequences](#HomologsCluster)  are not the same as the ones of HOGs. In the context of the ORTH ontology, a cluster can be interpreted as a tree with a root node and leaves (i.e.: without intermediate nodes). Figure 2 illustrates how the HOG depicted in Figure 2 can be represented as the non-hierarchical [clusters of homologous sequences](#HomologsCluster) . For the sake of simplicity, the inst:Passeriformes instance is not considered in Figure 2. In the context of the non-hierarchical clusters, a [Cluster of orthologs](#OrthologsCluster) must contain only instances of a [Gene](#Gene), [Protein](#Protein) or [gene region](#Subgene) which are all orthologs among them. In a similar way to the cluster of orthologs (i.e.: orth:OrthologsCluster), a [Cluster of paralogs](#ParalogsCluster) (i.e.: orth:ParalogsCluster) must contain only instances of a [Gene](#Gene), [Protein](#Protein) or [gene region](#Subgene) which are all paralogs among them. For example, we may notice that due to a duplication event in the HOG in Figure 2, two clusters of orthologs are explicitly defined at the Archelosauria taxonomic level (i.e.: inst:Archelosauria_1 and inst:Archelosauria_2) in Figure 2. Therefore, for each of these clusters all genes are orthologous to each other. For instance, the inst:Archelosauria_1 orthologous cluster [has homologous member](#hasHomologousMember)s the inst:S100P_PELSI, inst:S100P_FICAL and inst:S100P_TAEGU genes. However, the inst:Archelosauria_1 cluster does not have the inst:S100P_ANAPL gene as a member because this gene [is paralogous to](#hasParalog)  inst:S100P_FICAL and inst:S100P_TAEGU genes.

*Figure 2. A non hierarchical cluster instantiation example. For the sake of example and to improve readability, inst: is a prefix to indicate it is an instance of a class.*

![fig3](./images/fig3.png)

When comparing the data structure of the non-hierarchical clusters (i.e.: flat clusters) to HOGs, one may notice that flat clusters are a more verbose representation because we need to assign more triples to explicitly define flat cluster members which are implicitly described in a HOG. For example, we have to create two orthologous clusters (i.e. inst:Archelosauria_1 and inst:Archelosauria_2) at the same taxonomic level to represent orthologous groups at the Archelosauria taxon. These groups were derived from the HOG example in Figure 2. Moreover, a HOG contains more information that is not captured by non-hierarchical clusters such as the order of speciation and duplication events. This information is crucial to infer for instance [inparalogy relations](#InparalogyRelation).

Yet, we do not need to materialize flat cluster information from HOGs because we can infer or query them. Therefore, we recommend to materialise flat clusters only if they cannot be derived from a HOG or a use case where the number of derived clusters are small and/or the performance in terms of query execution time overcomes storage constraints. For example, some orthology databases do not predict orthology information as a HOG.

The query below retrieves the orthologous genes of inst:S100P_PELSI from the flat clusters illustrated in Figure 2. To query paralogy relations, we only need to replace orth:OrthologsCluster with orth:ParalogsCluster.

#### SPARQL Query
```
SELECT ?gene1 ?gene2 WHERE  { 
   ?cluster a orth:OrthologsCluster. 
   ?cluster orth:hasHomologousMember ?gene1. 
   ?cluster orth:hasHomologousMember ?gene2. 
  
   VALUES( ?gene1 ){ ( inst:S100P_PELSI ) }
   FILTER(?gene1 != ?gene2)
 }
```

#### Query results
```
gene1             gene2
inst:S100P_PELSI  inst:S100P_FICAL
inst:S100P_PELSI  inst:S100P_TAEGU
inst:S100P_PELSI  inst:S100P_ANAPL
```

Some examples of the orthology databases that provide non-hierarchical cluster of homologous sequences: [OMA](https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/), [OrthoDB](https://www.orthodb.org/) and [InParanoid](http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi).

### Pairwise-homology relations between sequences

By using ORTH ontology terms, we can describe, for example, the following homologous relations:

* [orthology relation](#OrthologyRelation)
* [paralogy relation](#ParalogyRelation)
* [outparalogy relation](#OutparalogyRelation)
* [inparalogy relation](#InparalogyRelation)
* [co-orthology relation](#CoOrthologyRelation)

The pairwise-homology relations are indeed defined as OWL classes rather than properties because frequently these relations are contextualised with respect to a [taxonomic level](#TaxonomicRange) of reference, a [speciation](#http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CDAO_0000121) event, a [geneDuplication](#http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CDAO_0000077) event, and so on. Besides this, due to the fact that the number of homology relations drastically increases with the number of genomes, it is recommended to materialise these relations if only if they cannot be derived from HOGs or flat clusters (see an example in Figure 3). Some orthology databases solely provide orthology pairwise relations. Therefore, a pairwise relation cannot explicitly be represented with a HOG or a non-hierarchical cluster.

*Figure 3. The pairwise-homologous relations between sequences derived from HOG illustrated in Figure 4 and flat cluster in Figure 2. For the sake of example and to improve readability, inst: is a prefix to indicate it is an instance of a class.*

![fig4](./images/fig4.png)

To facilitate the knowledge extraction, the ORTH pairwise-homology relation classes might be populated by applying Horn-like rules or queries over HOGs and/or flat clusters. Moreover, ORTH ontology also contains OWL object properties to represent non-contextualised homology pairwise relations by asserting the [has ortholog](#hasOrtholog), [has paralog](#hasParalog), [has xenolog](#hasXenolog) and [has homolog](#hasHomolog) object properties. One can notice that these properties might be inferred from the instances of ORTH pairwise-homology relation classes. Moreover, the pairwise-homology relations such as the inparalogy relation class cannot be defined as an OWL object property because it needs to be contextualised with respect to a speciation event of reference.

The query below retrieves the orthologous genes of inst:S100P_PELSI from the orthology-relations such as the one illustrated in Figure 3A. To query paralogy relations, we only need to replace orth:OrthologyRelation with orth:ParalogyRelation.


```
SELECT  ?gene1 ?gene2 WHERE  { 
   ?relation a orth:OrthologyRelation. 
   ?relation orth:hasHomologousMember ?gene1. 
   ?relation orth:hasHomologousMember ?gene2. 
  
   VALUES( ?gene1 ){ ( inst:S100P_PELSI ) }
   FILTER(?gene1 != ?gene2)
   }
```

If the [has ortholog](#hasOrtholog) property is inferred or materialised, the previous queries can be rewritten as follows:

```
SELECT ?gene1 ?gene2 WHERE  {  
   ?gene1 orth:hasOrtholog ?gene2. 
   VALUES( ?gene1 ){ ( inst:S100P_PELSI ) }
   }
```

###  Hierarchical orthologous group (HOG)

Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs) are defined as sets of genes that have descended from a single common ancestor within a taxonomic range of interest [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053786). In the computer science context, the data structure to represent a HOG is a Tree. Figure 4 depicts part of an instantiation example of a HOG with a root at the level of Archelosauria taxon (e.g., inst:Archelosauri). For the sake of simplicity, several property assertions are absent in Figure 4. When interpreting a HOG as a tree, the root node (e.g., inst:Archelosauria) must be an instance of orth:OrthologsCluster (i.e., labelled as [Cluster of orthologs](#OrthologsCluster)) the intermediate nodes must be instances of orth:OrthologsCluster or orth:ParalogsCluster (i.e., labelled as [Cluster of paralogs](#ParalogsCluster)). The leaves may be instances of [Gene](#Gene), [Protein](#Protein) or [gene region](#Subgene). A [Cluster of homologous sequences](#HomologsCluster) may contain other clusters (e.g., [Cluster of orthologs](#OrthologsCluster)) and [Sequence units](#SequenceUnit) (e.g., [Gene](#Gene)). To assign that a cluster contains another one, we should assert the orth:hasHomologousMember property (i.e., [has homologous member](#hasHomologousMember)) to a given [Cluster of homologous sequences](#HomologsCluster).

From the HOG illustrated in Figure 4, we can infer that inst:S100P_PELSI gene [is orthologous to](#hasOrtholog) inst:S100P_FICAL, inst:S100P_TAEGU and inst:S100P_ANAPL at the taxonomic level Archelosauria. In addition, inst:S100P_ANAPL [is paralogous to](#hasParalog) the orthologous genes inst:S100P_FICAL and inst:S100P_TAEGU due to the fact of a duplication event (i.e., inst:Duplication a [Cluster of paralogs](#ParalogsCluster)).

The query below retrieves the orthologous genes of inst:S100P_PELSI from the HOG illustrated in Figure 4. Depending on the type of orthology prediction, it can be [Gene](#Gene), [Protein](#Protein) or [gene region](#Subgene) based then the query below can be rewritten accordingly by replacing orth:SequenceUnit with orth:Gene, orth:Protein or orth:Subgene. To query paralogy relations, we only need to replace orth:OrthologsCluster with orth:ParalogsCluster.

#### SPARQL Query
```
SELECT ?gene1 ?gene2 WHERE  { 
   ?gene1 a orth:SequenceUnit. #Gene, [Protein](#Protein) or  [gene region](#Subgene)
   ?gene2 a orth:SequenceUnit. #Gene, [Protein](#Protein) or  [gene region](#Subgene)
   ?cluster a orth:OrthologsCluster. 
   ?cluster orth:hasHomologousMember ?node1. 
   ?cluster orth:hasHomologousMember ?node2. 
   ?node2 orth:hasHomologousMember* ?gene2. 
   ?node1 orth:hasHomologousMember* ?gene1. 
   
   VALUES( ?gene1 ){ ( inst:S100P_PELSI ) }
    
   FILTER(?node1 != ?node2)
   }
```

#### Query results
```
gene1             gene2
inst:S100P_PELSI  inst:S100P_FICAL
inst:S100P_PELSI  inst:S100P_TAEGU
inst:S100P_PELSI  inst:S100P_ANAPL
```
