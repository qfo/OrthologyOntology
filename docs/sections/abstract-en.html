<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown"></span>
<span>
The need of a common ontology for describing orthology information
in biological research communities has led to the creation of the Orthology Ontology (ORTH). 
 ORTH ontology is designed to describe sequence homology data available 
in multiple orthology databases on the Web (e.g.: <a href="https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/">OMA</a>,
 <a href="http://www.orthodb.org">OrthoDB</a>, <a href="http://hieranoidb.sbc.su.se">HieranoiDB</a>, and etc.). 
 By sequence homology data, we mostly mean gene region, gene and protein-centric orthology, paralogy, and xenology 
   information. Depending on the database, the homology information  is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology
   accommodates these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG),
    cluster of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences. 
    In addition to the specific ORTH terms, this specification includes terms of the imported ontologies 
    (e.g. Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, SIO) which are pertinent to represent the information from various
     orthology databases in a homogeneous way.
